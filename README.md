## Chat App

This repository contains a very basic implementation of a chat system. Please note that this repo is not meant to be used in a production environment; it's meant to be used as a starting point for developers to build their own chat system.

This project uses Node.js, Express.js, the Mustache template engine, and Socket.io for WebSocket support.

To keep this application simple, it doesn't use a database. Instead, it uses a simple array to keep track of its data.
